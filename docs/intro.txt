Introduction
==============

ermllitelib helps to process XML instance documents that obey the
ermllite XML schema.

With ermllitelib (ermllitelib.py) you can write
Python code to:

- Parse an XML document that obeys the ermllite XML schema,
  creating instances of the Python classes that represent the types
  defined in the ermllite schema.  These Python classes are
  defined in ermllitelib.py.

- Create instances of classes that represent the types described in
  the ermllite XML schema.

- Write Python application code that uses the classes that
  represent ermllite types.

- Export the objects to an XML document.


Schemas
---------

The ermllitelib.py module in this package was generated from the
XML schemas in ./schemas.


generateDS.py
---------------

The ermllitelib.py module in this package was generated by
generateDS.py.  You can learn about generateDS.py here:
